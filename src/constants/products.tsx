        <p>
          As a software engineer contractor with the Linux Foundation, I led the
          initiative to implement Content Security Policy (CSP) across the
          Jenkins core and top plugins, significantly strengthening platform
          defenses against cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work involved auditing and refactoring legacy codebases, removing
          inline scripts, updating unsafe event handlers, and modernizing plugin
          architecture to align with CSP requirementsâ€”all while maintaining
          backward compatibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          I collaborated closely with the Jenkins core maintainers and broader
          community, contributing to open-source security by enforcing modern
          security standards and improving resilience against injection attacks.
